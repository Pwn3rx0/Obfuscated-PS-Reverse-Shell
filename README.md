# PowerShell-Reverse-Shell

## 🔐 Obfuscated Reverse Shell Collection

**This repository contains obfuscated PowerShell reverse shells created for educational purposes only.**

### 📖 Purpose
I developed these payloads to study:
- Antivirus evasion techniques
- PowerShell obfuscation methods  
- Detection and prevention mechanisms
- Security research methodologies

### ⚠️ Disclaimer
**Legal Notice:** These scripts are provided for:
- Authorized penetration testing
- Security research and education
- Defensive security training
- Red team exercises with proper authorization

**I accept full responsibility for this research and have no problem being "burned" - this work is meant to be analyzed and improved upon by the security community.**

### 🔍 Detection Results
**VirusTotal Analysis:** *[Upload your samples to see detection rates]*

| Obfuscation Method | Detection Rate | Last Scan |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Basic Obfuscation | X/60 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Advanced Encoding | X/60 | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Multiple Techniques | X/60 | YYYY-MM-DD |

*Sample detection rates vary based on obfuscation techniques used*

### 🛡️ Defensive Value
This research helps:
- Security teams understand attack vectors
- Improve detection capabilities  
- Develop better mitigation strategies
- Train blue team personnel

### 📚 Educational Use Only
Use these techniques responsibly and only in environments you own or have explicit permission to test.
